# Super-Auto-Pets
AI for Super Auto Pets

Currently: Uses Deep Q-Learning to train AI.

V1.0: Trains AI directly with the game (plays against real people)

V6.0: Smarter training scheme, training against itself.

### To Do:

1. (V6.0): Train an accurate model in the simulation-based enviroment (training against itself)
2. (V1.0): Need to be able to get information from screen, to use that with what is used in V6.0
3. Git gud
4. ...
5. $$

### Acknowledgements

This implementation is based on the work by [HJK-Z](https://github.com/HJK-Z/Super-Auto-Pets), with aim to improve the design with smarter reinforcement learning schemes.
The game logic is built around [sapai](https://github.com/manny405/sapai).
